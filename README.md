# Software Developer Exercise

## General Guidance:
	- Upload the template project to a private gitlab repository
	- Add @RCDTS as a developer on the created project.
	- All commit messages should follow the template of:
		SDE-{TASK_ID + Unique 3 digit code}: {COMMIT MESSAGE}
		e.g. SDE-0001: Uploaded initial project template
	- Ensure that any added functionality or corrected errors have appropriately named JUnit tests to ensure they work. 
	- Where instructions are vague, reasonable assumptions should be made and documented

## Task 1:
	GIVEN I am an ORGANISER
	WHEN viewing events
	THEN I want to see only future events


## Task 2:
	GIVEN I am an ORGANISER
	WHEN viewing events
	THEN I want an option to view next 5 events or all events

	
## Task 3:
	GIVEN I am an ORGANISER
	WHEN I add an EVENT, I want to be asked what kind of event it is
	AND I want the options to be SOCIAL, PRIVATE, PUBLIC or OTHER 
 	THEN the event is saved
